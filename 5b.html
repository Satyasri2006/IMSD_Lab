Hello Vardhan, 

Okay, it's not fair. You're making me smile at my phone screen like an idiot, and I usually don't do that unless I'm reading a good webtoon comic, so, as I mentioned, not fair. But, thank you, really. 

Yeah, Crime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov, and The Idiot, so many great works by him. I'm still in the first book, but I want to read them all. 

Yeah, that book (The Fault in our Stars) is unarguably one of the most beautiful books ever written. It really makes me emotional, and all, but still I put myself there again and again. I can't help it. 

Chetan Bhagat? Amazing. I mean I haven't read a single book, but I heard so much, and saw many of his books in the library. I should pick up one of his books soon. Also, yeah, I've watched 2 States. And the songs in it, chef's kiss. Also, I think it's the only Arjun Kapoor movie I've watched haha. Sherlock, another great choice, I see. Okay, I'm going to do the inevitable and ask you this, Do you like the movies more, or the series? (assuming you've watched them?) 

Wow, I think you should try writing poetry, alongside sketching. Your words sound beautifully poetic. And coming to your dream, it sounds poetically beautiful :)

Uh, It's rare for me to get some pleasant dreams honestly. I get nightmares sometimes, those are the worst. But most of the times, I get these elaborated stories where finally I'd kill someone I know, or I get killed by someone I know. Always. But I once had this dream where I was standing on the deck of some kind of ship, and suddenly someone pushed me and I fell down into a sea maybe. I couldn't breathe, and I'm trying to swim to the surface (I don't even know how to swim irl haha). But then suddenly someone grabbed me and pulled me down further into the water and the next thing I knew I was on the ship deck again. And then the same dream reoccurred, and again, and again. After some time, I don't know how but before that someone tried to push me, I turned around. I saw the face of someone I know, and they just stabbed me. I saw my hands and they were bloody. They pushed me again, and then, I woke up. But I still felt pain in my stomach that day, and had an uneasy feeling. It was only one of my weird dreams.

I'm a B. Tech. student too, a CSE first-year. Summer break already? I mean, I'm just wishing it's the same for us. Yeah, I get you in a way. I'm an introvert too. I definitely understand, because it's the same for me. So, how's studies going on? I totally understand if that's something you don't want to talk about, because I definitely don't want to talk much about it :) 

You know what's really funny... I wrote this letter right after I got yours, at around midnight. But I haven't sent it.
Now I checked if you've sent anything, and saw that I, haven't sent anything.

PS : My name's Satya. I forgot to mention that.

It's like, you know, like in old movies, someone stands clinging to the doorframe, waiting, and when the letter arrives, they tear open the letter, and read it.
